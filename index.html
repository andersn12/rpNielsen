                    <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft" >Large-scale electrolysis for hydrogen production can potentially provide a clean alternative to environmentally hazardous energy sources that are used today. Besides creating clean energy, seawater electrolysis also purifies seawater into drinking water. The study analyzed how various electrolysis voltages impacted the rate of the hydrogen generation from seawater. It was hypothesized that an optimal electrolysis voltage exists to efficiently produce hydrogen at the fastest rate possible. It was predicted that the rate of hydrogen would lessen after a certain amount of time due to corrosion of the anode. During the research, electrolysis was carried out on seven different voltages, two of them being controls, with three trials for each condition. Each trial was run for 24 hours and the total volume of hydrogen was recorded every 30 minutes. The study did not conclude that a certain voltage was optimal for hydrogen generation. However, the results showed an unexpected difference between the rate of hydrogen generation for the 4.0 volt condition compared to the 5.0 volt condition. In addition to this, it was concluded that corrosion influenced the results of the study, which could motivate future studies to research corrosion during seawater electrolysis.</p>
